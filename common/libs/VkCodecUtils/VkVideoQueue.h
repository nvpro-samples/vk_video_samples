 *
 * This class provides a mechanism to access decoded frames (`FrameDataType`) and to manage
 * those frames once the application is done processing them. The methods to query frame
 * properties (e.g., width, height, bit depth, and format) may return valid results
 * immediately after the decoder instance is created if the underlying
 * `videoStreamDemuxer` supports video stream probing. Otherwise, these methods will return
 * the correct format information only after sufficient data has been parsed by
 * ParserProcessNextDataChunk().
 *
 * @tparam FrameDataType The type representing a decoded frame data type.
